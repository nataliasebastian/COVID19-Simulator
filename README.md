# COVID-19 Simulator
This is a COVID-19 simulation model developed in Greenfoot, an integrated development environment, using Java.

The simulator represents graphically the number of infections to compare the effect of COVID-19 in different environments. 

## Results
### Simulation for different size populations
This simulation represents 3 countries with different population densities. We can check that countries with higher densities per m2 suffer worse consequences.

### Simulation for countries with different restrictions
This simulation represents 3 countries with different restriction levels imposed by their respective govrenments. This restrictions consists on isolating X% of the population (they do not move). We can check that countries with higher restrictions reduce the spread of the virus
